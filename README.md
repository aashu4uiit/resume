## Current generation steps
* Install resume-cli `npm install -g resume-cli`
* Validation will fail so just serve instead `resume serve --theme onepage`
* Copy html from generated public folder
* Export pdf from browser

Would be nice to figure out the validation to use the export commands. Seems the date format is pretty restrictive.
